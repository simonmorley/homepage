## Work Stuff

A hands-on CTO and software engineer. I love creating solutions for problems that seem impossible to solve.

As of November 2022, I'm the CTO at a Crypto exchange. It's quite a strange space to work. Over a couple years, I've done a bunch of cool software type things that have helped them continue to succeed. Turns out I'm also quite a motivating and driven manager of people. 

I've written bots to automate trades and balance their liquidity pools. I re-wrote their entire trading platform and API. Introduced a bunch of new crypto currencies. Added support for FIAT currencies. Wrote some solidity contracts to process inbound and outbound ETH and ERC20 transactions. Hired a bunch of developers. Built and implemented compliance rules and systems so they could get a licence to trade. Integrated a custodian and cold wallet provider to secure their funds. I also helped them release their own stablecoin via an "IBCO".

Since 2004, I've founded about 5 different startups:

- Cucumber Tony: Remote management solution for WiFi access points
- PolkaSpots: WiFi Hotspots and Installations
- Perched: AirBnb for kitchens
- Phil: contactless payment services for homeless people
- MIMO: Open-source WiFi splash pages and marketing tools

I've closed them all now.

## Software languages

I've used the following extensively in production environments:

Golang, Python, Solidity, Javascript, NodeJS, Ruby.

Other stuff:

I love using Jupyter notebooks, Pandas etc. Have done some ML stuff at Cucumber Tony where we were learning from the WiFi data that we'd stored.

I'm currently learning c++. I've written software for embedded devices using c. I'm comfortable with Rust too.

## Devops Stuff

I've automated pretty much everything at all the companies I've worked at using Kubernetes mostly. 

Kubernetes, Google Cloud, CI (Jenkins, Circle, Cloud Builds, GH Actions), Cloudflare.

## Crypto Development

I've written a bunch of Solidity contracts which are now live on mainnet. These ranged from proxy contracts, ERC20 contracts and entire platforms to launch a stablecoin. The deployment of these contracts was mostly done using Hardhat, with some Remix in there too. I've also implemented a Geth node on Kubernetes, and built a bunch of integrations around this. 

Other than Ethereum, I've built numerous systems on other blockchains, include Bitcoin, Litecoin etc.

## Non Work Stuff

I took a year off to become a professional Ironman. Sadly that didn't work out because COVID caused all the races to be cancelled. But I can however still call myself an Ironman!

I cycle and run pretty much every day. I read a lot of books, anything I can get my hands on really although I did NOT enjoy Ulysses, nor could I finish it.

My family and I have an allotment where we grow a bunch of tasty fruit and vegetables. We also have some bees! I built a "bee monitor" using a raspberry PI.


## This Blog

Oringally, I wrote it using markdown, and Gatsby. And Cloudflare's Workers. This seemed like a good idea at the time. Months went by and I didn't update any blogs. Then one day, when inspiration hit, I came to write something and couldn't get Gatsby to work. Some dependency nonsense.

This is my beef with so much open-source stuff we tend to rely on. It changes so much and, while they mostly all promise to be 'backwards compatible', they rarely are.

So, I'm back on good old Github pages.
